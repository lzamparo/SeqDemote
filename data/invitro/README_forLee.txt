These CSI-Seq files are 20bp reads.

These data has not been published.

hbZIPs
For hbZIPs, we used purified DNA binding domains that were biotin labeled. We used a DNA library with a 20bp randomized region, and did a total of 3 rounds of enrichment. I included the 3rd round sequencing data for bZIP homodimers (ATF3, CEBPA) and heterodimers (ATF3:CEBPA, ATF3:CEBPG, BATF:CEBPA, BATF:CEBPE, JUNB:ATF2, JUNB:FOS, JUNB:CEBPA, JUNB:CEBPE).
I also include the corresponding starting libraries (round 0). The files are 20bp reads.


hNRs
For hNRs, we use cell lysates from HEK293 cells overexpressing N-terminus HALO-tag fusions of full-length human Nuclear Receptors. Incubated with a 20bp library, and purified using magnetic particles that react with the Halo-tag.
We did a total of 3 rounds and include files for all 3 rounds. The control files are the negative controls in which we use HEK293 lysate overexpressing only the Halo-tag protein. The files are 20bp reads.
